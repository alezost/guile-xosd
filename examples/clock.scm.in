;;; Commentary:

;; This script displays clock (i.e., the current time updated every
;; second) in the center of your screen.

;;; Code:

(use-modules (xosd))

(define (setup-clock osd)
  "Set up OSD object to display the clock."
  (set-osd-position! osd 'middle)
  (set-osd-align! osd 'center)
  (set-osd-font! osd "-*-dejavu sans-bold-r-normal-*-*-600-*-*-p-*-*-1")
  (set-osd-color! osd "LimeGreen")
  (set-osd-shadow-offset! osd 3))

(define (display-clock osd)
  "Display the current time in OSD object.
This procedure never exits."
  (display-string-in-osd osd (strftime "%T" (localtime (current-time))))
  (sleep 1)
  (display-clock osd))

(when (batch-mode?)
  (let ((osd (create-osd 1)))
    (setup-clock osd)
    (display-clock osd)))

* About

Guile-XOSD provides the Guile bindings for [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/libxosd/][libxosd]] library.

Guile-XOSD is the reincarnation of [[https://github.com/sigma/lisposd][lisposd]].  The C file with the Guile
bindings was written at the time (2004-2005) by Yann Hodique, and the
rest (GNU Build System infrastructure, guile modules, documentation and
examples) was added as a part of Guile-XOSD in 2016 by Alex Kost.

* Usage

From the following screenshots you can get the idea how Guile-XOSD may
be used:

- [[http://i.imgur.com/XCn4ysP.png]]

And here is the code to display the OSD from the second screenshot:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(use-modules (xosd))

(define osd
  (make-osd #:lines 2
            #:position 'top
            #:align 'center
            #:font "-*-ubuntu-bold-r-normal--*-500-*-*-p-*-*-1"
            #:color "dark green"
            #:outline-offset 1
            #:outline-color "white"))

(define (display-percentage percent)
  (display-string-in-osd osd (format #f "~a%" percent) 0)
  (display-percentage-in-osd osd percent 1))

(display-percentage 73)
#+END_SRC

The full documentation (texinfo manual) and a couple of other examples
can be found in the source tree (and in the installed package).

* Building from Git

Along with the obvious requirements for Guile-XOSD:

- [[http://gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]]
- [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/libxosd/][XOSD]] library

to build it from git, you also need:

- [[http://gnu.org/software/autoconf/][GNU Autoconf]]
- [[http://gnu.org/software/automake/][GNU Automake]]
- [[http://gnu.org/software/libtool/][GNU Libtool]]
- [[http://gnu.org/software/texinfo/][GNU Texinfo]]

Run =./autogen.sh= to generate the build system infrastructure.  After
that, the program can be built and installed with the usual sequence of
commands of the GNU Build System:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
#+END_SRC

It is possible to use/test Guile-XOSD without installing (i.e., after
running =make= but before running =make install=) with the help of
=pre-inst-env= script in the top build tree, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./pre-inst-env guile
scheme@(guile-user)> ,use(xosd)
#+END_SRC

* Building/installing with Guix

The latest version of Guile-XOSD can be installed with [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/][GNU Guix]]:
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/packages/g.html#guile-xosd]].

Also this repository contains [[file:guix.scm]] file which can be used to
build/install Guile-XOSD using the git checkout, or to make a
development environment for it (see the commentary in that file for more
details).

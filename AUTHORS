Yann Hodique <Yann.Hodique@lifl.fr> is the original author of "lisposd"
<https://github.com/sigma/lisposd>, i.e., of the C file with Guile
bindings.

Alex Kost <alezost@gmail.com> replaced the original C code with Guile
code and wrote all the rest (GNU Build System infrastructure,
documentation and examples).
